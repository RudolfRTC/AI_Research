## Summary (200-300 words)

Cahn and Haasen's Physical Metallurgy is the authoritative multi-volume reference covering the full spectrum of physical metallurgy. For this research, the most relevant chapters address phase transformations in steels (austenite decomposition to ferrite, pearlite, bainite, martensite), grain boundary structure and properties, precipitation hardening, and the relationship between microstructure and physical/mechanical properties. The book provides detailed treatment of how heat treatment parameters (austenitising temperature, cooling rate, tempering) control the resulting microstructure of low-alloy steels. Continuous cooling transformation (CCT) and time-temperature-transformation (TTT) diagrams are explained with reference to alloying element effects. The discussion of electron transport in metals and alloys covers the same microstructural features (solutes, grain boundaries, precipitates, dislocations) that determine both conductivity and mechanical behaviour. This dual coverage makes the text uniquely valuable as the theoretical bridge between conductivity and machinability. The chapters on deformation mechanisms and strengthening mechanisms (solid solution, grain boundary, precipitation, dislocation) explain how microstructure controls hardness and flow stress, which in turn determine machinability.

## Key Findings

1. Microstructural features (grain boundaries, phases, precipitates, dislocations) simultaneously affect electrical, thermal, and mechanical properties
2. Heat treatment provides systematic control over microstructure and therefore over both conductivity and mechanical properties
3. The same lattice defects that scatter electrons also impede dislocation motion, creating the physical link between conductivity and strength/hardness
4. Alloying elements partition between phases during transformation, affecting both local conductivity and local mechanical response

## Methodology

- **Materials:** Broad coverage of metals and alloys with emphasis on steels
- **Experimental setup:** Compiled from the global metallurgical research community
- **Measurement techniques:** Metallography, XRD, TEM, dilatometry, calorimetry
- **Analysis methods:** Thermodynamics of phase transformations, diffusion theory, strengthening models

## Data and Results

- **Steel grades tested:** Generic treatment of Fe-C, Fe-C-X systems
- **Key quantitative results:** CCT/TTT diagram features; strengthening increments per mechanism; phase fraction vs. cooling rate relationships
- **Figures/tables of interest:** CCT diagrams for low-alloy steels; Hall-Petch coefficients; precipitation strengthening data

## Relevance to Research Questions

### RQ1 (Conductivity-Machinability)
Indirect but essential -- provides the microstructural framework that links conductivity and machinability.

### RQ2 (Microstructural Mediation)
Central reference. Quantifies how microstructure affects both conductivity and mechanical properties, establishing the mediation pathway.

### RQ3 (Measurement Methods)
Limited direct relevance to measurement techniques.

### RQ4 (Predictive Model)
Provides physical basis for selecting model input variables (grain size, phase fractions, precipitate characteristics).

## Connections to Other Literature

- **Builds on:** Classical thermodynamics and diffusion theory
- **Contradicts:** N/A (foundational reference)
- **Complements:** rossiter_1987_electrical, thelning_1984_steel, smithells_2004_metals

## Critical Evaluation

- **Strengths:** Encyclopaedic coverage; authoritative contributors; strong theoretical foundations
- **Limitations:** Very broad scope means limited depth on specific alloy systems; pre-dates some modern characterisation techniques
- **Gaps:** Does not explicitly connect microstructure to machinability or attempt non-destructive property prediction

## Follow-up Actions
- [ ] Extract specific data on microstructure-property relationships for low-alloy steels
- [ ] Cross-reference phase transformation effects with resistivity data from rossiter_1987_electrical
- [ ] Use strengthening mechanism data to build mediation model for RQ2
