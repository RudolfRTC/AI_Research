## Summary (200-300 words)

Das et al. present an experimental study on the machining of AISI 4340 low-alloy steel, one of the key target materials for this dissertation. The study investigates the effect of cutting parameters (speed, feed, depth of cut) on surface roughness (Ra) and flank wear (VB) during turning with coated carbide inserts. The experiments follow a systematic design of experiments (DoE) approach using Taguchi L27 orthogonal array. The authors measure surface roughness and tool flank wear at each experimental condition and develop empirical models using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and regression analysis. AISI 4340 was tested in the hardened condition (approximately 48 HRC). The study finds that cutting speed is the most significant parameter affecting tool wear, while feed rate most strongly influences surface roughness. Optimal cutting conditions are identified through the Taguchi signal-to-noise ratio analysis. This paper provides directly usable machinability data for AISI 4340, one of the target steel grades. The cutting force, surface roughness, and tool wear data can be paired with conductivity data for 4340 in the evidence matrix.

## Key Findings

1. Cutting speed is the dominant factor for flank wear (contribution > 50%)
2. Feed rate is the dominant factor for surface roughness (contribution > 60%)
3. Optimal conditions identified: moderate speed, low feed, moderate depth of cut
4. Coated carbide inserts show acceptable tool life for hardened 4340 at optimised conditions

## Methodology

- **Materials:** AISI 4340 steel, hardened to ~48 HRC
- **Experimental setup:** CNC turning, Taguchi L27 DoE, coated carbide inserts (CNMG)
- **Measurement techniques:** Surface profilometer (Ra), optical microscope (VB), dynamometer (cutting forces)
- **Analysis methods:** Taguchi method, ANOVA, regression analysis, S/N ratio optimisation

## Data and Results

- **Steel grades tested:** AISI 4340 (~48 HRC)
- **Key quantitative results:** Ra range 0.4-2.8 um; VB range 0.05-0.35 mm; ANOVA contribution percentages
- **Figures/tables of interest:** Main effects plots; ANOVA tables; surface roughness and wear vs. cutting parameters

## Relevance to Research Questions

### RQ1 (Conductivity-Machinability)
Provides machinability data (Ra, VB) for AISI 4340 that can be paired with conductivity data for correlation.

### RQ2 (Microstructural Mediation)
Single heat treatment condition tested; limited microstructural variation.

### RQ3 (Measurement Methods)
Not relevant to conductivity measurement.

### RQ4 (Predictive Model)
Taguchi/ANOVA methodology; empirical regression models provide comparison benchmarks.

## Connections to Other Literature

## Critical Evaluation

- **Strengths:** Directly relevant steel grade; systematic DoE; quantitative data
- **Limitations:** Single heat treatment condition; no microstructural characterisation; no conductivity measurement
- **Gaps:** Missing conductivity data for the same specimens; only hardened condition tested
