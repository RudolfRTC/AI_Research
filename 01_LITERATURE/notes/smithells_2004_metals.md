## Summary (200-300 words)

Smithells Metals Reference Book is the pre-eminent compilation of physical, mechanical, and chemical property data for metals and alloys. The electrical properties section provides resistivity and temperature coefficient of resistivity data for pure metals, binary alloys, and commercial alloy systems including steels. For iron and steel alloys, the book tabulates resistivity as a function of composition, heat treatment state, and temperature. The data enables calculation of conductivity from composition for many standard alloy systems. The mechanical properties sections provide tensile strength, yield strength, hardness, and impact toughness data for the same alloys, enabling cross-correlation with electrical data. The thermophysical properties section (thermal conductivity, specific heat) complements the electrical data because thermal and electrical conductivity are linked through the Wiedemann-Franz law. For this research, Smithells serves as the primary source of tabulated resistivity data for low-alloy steels, providing the conductivity values that can be paired with machinability data from other sources (e.g., davis_1998_machinability) to build the evidence matrix. The extensive composition-resistivity tables also support the microstructural mediation analysis by showing how alloying elements change resistivity.

## Key Findings

1. Comprehensive resistivity data tabulated for steels by composition and heat treatment state
2. Temperature coefficient of resistivity provided, essential for measurement standardisation
3. Wiedemann-Franz relation links electrical and thermal conductivity
4. Alloying elements increase resistivity of iron in a systematic, quantifiable manner

## Methodology
