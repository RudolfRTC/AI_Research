## Summary (200-300 words)

ASTM E1004-17 defines the standard procedure for measuring electrical conductivity of metallic materials using the electromagnetic (eddy-current) method. The standard specifies that measurements are expressed in percentage of the International Annealed Copper Standard (%IACS) or in megasiemens per meter (MS/m). It covers probe selection, calibration using certified reference standards, measurement procedure, temperature correction, and reporting requirements. The standard applies primarily to non-ferromagnetic metals and alloys; for ferromagnetic materials (including steels), the standard explicitly notes that magnetic permeability complicates the measurement, and separate consideration is required. The calibration procedure requires a minimum of two reference standards bracketing the expected conductivity range, with a linear interpolation between calibration points. Temperature correction is specified as essential, with the test piece temperature recorded and results corrected to a reference temperature (typically 20 degrees C). The standard discusses probe lift-off effects, edge proximity effects, and minimum specimen thickness requirements. Measurement uncertainty is addressed through repeatability requirements. This standard is directly relevant to RQ3 as it defines the primary non-contact conductivity measurement method that could be used for machinability prediction.

## Key Findings

1. Eddy current conductivity measurement is standardised for non-ferromagnetic metals; ferromagnetic materials require special consideration
2. Calibration with certified reference standards is mandatory; minimum two standards required
3. Temperature correction is essential -- conductivity varies approximately 0.1%/C for most metals
4. Minimum specimen thickness and probe-to-edge distance requirements must be met

## Methodology

- **Materials:** Applicable to metallic materials (primarily non-ferromagnetic)
- **Experimental setup:** Eddy current probe, impedance analyser or dedicated instrument
- **Measurement techniques:** Electromagnetic induction, impedance measurement
- **Analysis methods:** Calibration curve interpolation, temperature correction

## Data and Results

- **Steel grades tested:** Standard applies to metals generally; limited for ferromagnetic steels
- **Key quantitative results:** Repeatability requirement specified; uncertainty budget framework
- **Figures/tables of interest:** Calibration procedure diagram; temperature correction factors

## Relevance to Research Questions

### RQ1 (Conductivity-Machinability)
Defines how to measure the conductivity variable in the conductivity-machinability relationship.

### RQ2 (Microstructural Mediation)
Indirect -- the measurement must be reliable for mediation analysis to be valid.

### RQ3 (Measurement Methods)
Directly relevant. Defines the eddy current measurement protocol, its limitations for ferromagnetic steels, and uncertainty requirements.

### RQ4 (Predictive Model)
Measurement uncertainty from this standard informs model input uncertainty.
