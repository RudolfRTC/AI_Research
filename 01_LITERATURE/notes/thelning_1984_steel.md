## Summary (200-300 words)

Thelning's Steel and its Heat Treatment is a comprehensive practical and theoretical reference covering the heat treatment of steels and the resulting microstructural changes. The book provides detailed treatment of how austenitising temperature, cooling rate, and tempering conditions determine the final microstructure (ferrite, pearlite, bainite, martensite, tempered martensite) and consequently the mechanical properties. For low-alloy steels (e.g., AISI 4140, 4340), the book presents continuous cooling transformation (CCT) diagrams, Jominy hardenability curves, and tempering response data. These microstructural transformations are the same ones that determine both electrical conductivity and machinability. Thelning discusses how alloying elements (Cr, Mo, Ni, V, Mn) shift transformation temperatures, affect hardenability, and influence precipitation behaviour during tempering. The carbide precipitation sequence during tempering (epsilon-carbide to cementite to alloy carbides) is described in detail -- these precipitates scatter conduction electrons and also affect chip formation during machining. The book provides hardness vs. tempering temperature curves for common alloy steels, which can be cross-referenced with conductivity data to establish the tempering-based conductivity-hardness-machinability pathway. Thelning also discusses residual stresses from heat treatment and their potential effect on both eddy current measurements and machining behaviour.

## Key Findings

1. CCT diagrams for low-alloy steels show how cooling rate determines microstructure and properties
2. Tempering produces systematic changes: precipitation of carbides, recovery of dislocations, relief of internal stresses
3. Alloying elements retard softening during tempering by forming stable alloy carbides
4. Hardenability (depth of hardening) is a critical factor for uniformity of properties through the workpiece cross-section

## Methodology

- **Materials:** Carbon steels, low-alloy steels, tool steels, stainless steels
- **Experimental setup:** Compiled from metallurgical research and industrial practice
- **Measurement techniques:** Dilatometry, hardness testing, metallography, Jominy test
- **Analysis methods:** Phase transformation theory, TTT/CCT analysis, hardenability calculations

## Data and Results

- **Steel grades tested:** AISI 1045, 4130, 4140, 4340, 8620, 52100, H13, and many others
- **Key quantitative results:** CCT diagrams; tempering curves (hardness vs. temperature); Jominy profiles
- **Figures/tables of interest:** CCT diagrams for key alloy steels; hardness vs. tempering temperature charts; hardenability band data

## Relevance to Research Questions

### RQ1 (Conductivity-Machinability)
Provides heat treatment-property relationships that link to both conductivity and machinability.

### RQ2 (Microstructural Mediation)
Central reference for understanding how heat treatment produces specific microstructures that mediate both conductivity and machinability.

### RQ3 (Measurement Methods)
Limited direct relevance, though residual stress discussion is relevant to eddy current measurement.

### RQ4 (Predictive Model)
Heat treatment parameters as model inputs; tempering curves as validation data.
