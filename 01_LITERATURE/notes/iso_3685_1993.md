## Summary (200-300 words)

ISO 3685:1993 is the international standard defining the procedures for tool-life testing in single-point turning operations. The standard specifies workpiece preparation, tool geometry, cutting conditions, tool wear measurement procedures, and tool life criteria. The primary tool life criterion is flank wear land width VB = 0.3 mm (uniform wear) or VBmax = 0.6 mm (localised wear). The standard also defines crater wear parameters (KT, KM, KB) and notch wear. Cutting conditions (speed, feed, depth of cut) are specified as standardised test conditions, with requirements for maintaining constant conditions throughout the test. The standard requires measurement of tool wear at regular intervals using optical microscopy. Tool life is defined as the cutting time to reach the specified wear criterion. For machinability comparison between materials, the standard recommends testing at multiple cutting speeds and constructing Taylor tool-life curves (VT^n = C). This standard is essential for RQ1 because it defines how machinability (through tool life) should be measured to enable valid comparisons between materials and correlation with conductivity measurements. It also provides the framework for the machining test protocol in the dissertation methodology.

## Key Findings

1. Flank wear VB = 0.3 mm is the standard tool life end-of-life criterion
2. Taylor tool-life equation (VT^n = C) provides the standard machinability comparison framework
3. Standardised cutting conditions and tool geometry are essential for valid material comparison
4. Multiple cutting speeds required to establish the full tool-life curve

## Methodology

- **Materials:** Applicable to all workpiece materials in turning
- **Experimental setup:** CNC or engine lathe with controlled cutting conditions
- **Measurement techniques:** Optical microscopy for tool wear measurement
- **Analysis methods:** Taylor tool-life curve fitting; logarithmic regression

## Data and Results

- **Steel grades tested:** Standard applicable to all materials
- **Key quantitative results:** Wear criteria definitions; recommended cutting condition ranges
- **Figures/tables of interest:** Flank wear measurement diagram; crater wear parameter definitions; tool-life curve example

## Relevance to Research Questions

### RQ1 (Conductivity-Machinability)
Defines the machinability metric (tool life at VB = 0.3 mm) for the conductivity-machinability correlation.

### RQ2 (Microstructural Mediation)
Indirect -- standardised testing enables valid material comparison for mediation analysis.

### RQ3 (Measurement Methods)
Defines machining-side measurement methodology.

### RQ4 (Predictive Model)
Tool life prediction target (VB = 0.3 mm criterion) comes from this standard.
