## Summary (200-300 words)

ASTM B193-16 defines the standard procedure for measuring the DC electrical resistivity of metallic conductor materials using the four-probe (Kelvin) method. The standard specifies specimen geometry requirements (wire, bar, or strip), current source requirements, voltage measurement requirements, and the four-terminal measurement configuration that eliminates contact resistance errors. The Kelvin (four-probe) configuration uses separate current-carrying and voltage-sensing contacts, ensuring that contact resistance does not influence the measurement. The standard requires measurement of specimen dimensions (length between voltage contacts, cross-sectional area) to convert measured resistance to resistivity. Temperature measurement and correction procedures are specified. The standard is applicable to all metallic materials regardless of magnetic properties, making it suitable for ferromagnetic steels where eddy current methods face complications. Measurement uncertainty is addressed through requirements for current stability, voltmeter resolution, and dimensional measurement accuracy. The standard provides a direct, absolute measurement of resistivity, which can be converted to conductivity. For this research, ASTM B193 provides the reference method against which eddy current measurements can be compared.
