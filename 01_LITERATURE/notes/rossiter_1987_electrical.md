## Summary (200-300 words)

Rossiter's monograph is the definitive treatment of electrical resistivity in metals and alloys from a solid-state physics perspective. The book develops the theory of electron scattering from various sources: phonons (thermal), impurities (substitutional and interstitial solutes), grain boundaries, dislocations, vacancies, precipitates, and phase boundaries. Matthiessen's rule, which states that total resistivity is the sum of independent scattering contributions, is rigorously derived and its deviations catalogued. For steel and iron alloys, Rossiter provides data on the resistivity contributions of common alloying elements (C, Mn, Si, Cr, Ni, Mo, V) per atomic percent. The book explains how phase transformations (austenite to ferrite, pearlite, bainite, or martensite) change resistivity through altered solute distributions, new phase boundaries, and changed dislocation densities. The effect of cold work (increased dislocation density) and annealing (recovery and recrystallisation) on resistivity is quantified. This text establishes the fundamental physics connecting microstructure to conductivity, which is half of the bridge needed for this dissertation. The temperature dependence of resistivity is treated in detail, including the Bloch-Grueneisen theory for phonon scattering, essential for measurement standardisation.

## Key Findings

1. Matthiessen's rule allows decomposition of resistivity into microstructural contributions
2. Carbon in solid solution increases resistivity of iron by approximately 3.4 micro-ohm-cm per at.%
3. Phase transformations produce large resistivity changes: martensite >> bainite > pearlite > ferrite (for same composition)
4. Grain boundary scattering contributes measurably to resistivity in fine-grained materials

## Methodology

- **Materials:** Pure metals, binary and multicomponent alloys, steels
- **Experimental setup:** Compiled experimental data from literature
- **Measurement techniques:** Four-probe DC resistivity, temperature-dependent measurements
- **Analysis methods:** Quantum mechanical scattering theory, Boltzmann transport equation

## Data and Results

- **Steel grades tested:** Various iron-based alloys (pure Fe, Fe-C, Fe-Cr, Fe-Ni, etc.)
- **Key quantitative results:** Resistivity increments per at.% for each alloying element; phase-dependent resistivity values; temperature coefficients
- **Figures/tables of interest:** Tables of resistivity increments per solute atom; resistivity vs. temperature curves; phase transformation effects

## Relevance to Research Questions

### RQ1 (Conductivity-Machinability)
Provides the conductivity-side physics. Understanding what microstructural features change conductivity is essential for building the conductivity-machinability bridge.

### RQ2 (Microstructural Mediation)
Directly quantifies how each microstructural feature (solutes, phases, grain boundaries, dislocations) contributes to resistivity. This is the conductivity side of the mediation model.

### RQ3 (Measurement Methods)
Discusses measurement principles and temperature correction methodologies.

### RQ4 (Predictive Model)
Matthiessen's rule decomposition provides a physics-based framework for model inputs.

## Connections to Other Literature

## Critical Evaluation

- **Strengths:** Rigorous physics treatment; comprehensive data compilation; quantitative framework
- **Limitations:** Pre-dates modern computational methods; limited coverage of complex commercial alloy systems
- **Gaps:** Does not connect resistivity to mechanical or machining properties
