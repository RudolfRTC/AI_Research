## Summary (200-300 words)

Ghoni et al. investigate the use of eddy current imaging for defect characterisation and quantification in metallic components. The study uses a scanning eddy current probe to generate 2D maps (C-scans) of impedance variations across a specimen surface. These impedance maps reveal defects (cracks, inclusions, porosity) through local variations in conductivity and permeability. The authors develop signal processing algorithms to extract defect characteristics (size, depth, orientation) from the impedance data. The study demonstrates that eddy current imaging can detect and quantify defects as small as 0.5 mm in length. Multi-frequency measurements are used to separate surface and subsurface defect indications. The spatial resolution of eddy current imaging depends on probe size and frequency, with higher frequencies providing better surface resolution but reduced penetration. For this dissertation, eddy current imaging techniques could be applied to map conductivity variations across workpiece surfaces, revealing microstructural inhomogeneities that affect local machinability. The signal processing methods for extracting quantitative information from impedance data are directly transferable to conductivity measurement methodology. The defect characterisation algorithms also demonstrate how eddy current data can be linked to microstructural features.
