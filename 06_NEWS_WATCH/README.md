Alert setup, monthly literature digests, and conference calendar.

## Google Scholar Alerts

Set alerts for the top cross-pillar queries from `00_README/keywords_queries.md`:

1. `"electrical conductivity" AND "machinability"`
2. `"resistivity" AND "machinability" AND "steel"`
3. `"eddy current" AND "machinability"`
4. `"non-destructive testing" AND "machinability" AND "prediction"`
5. `"conductivity" AND "tool wear" AND "steel"`

## Review Schedule

- Monthly: review alert results, screen for relevance
- Quarterly: update `01_LITERATURE/library.bib` and evidence matrix with new findings

## Relevant Conferences

- CIRP (manufacturing research)
- ASME MSEC (manufacturing science and engineering)
- ICME (materials engineering)
- NDT conferences (non-destructive testing)
